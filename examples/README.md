# Examples

Contained here are the examples used throughout the semester.
The examples will be updated weekly.

You should download these notebooks and explore them yourself!

A brief description of each example follows.

- **Numbers_and_Precision.ipynb**:
This shows the main difficulty with numerical work -- finite precision!
- **Algorithm_Choice.ipynb**:
An example showing that all mathematically equivalent algorithms do not behave the same way numerically.
- **Animated_Root_Finding.ipynb**:
An example using ipywidgets to animate the steps of root finding algorithms. This is most easily run under the classic notebook interface, not Jupyter Lab.
- **Root_Finding.ipynb**:
An example showing the use of routines from `scipy.optimize` for one dimensional root finding.
